# Recipe Storage Bin
Application where users can create an account -> sign in and manage recipes

## Why?
Wanted to start learning some TypeScript and heard about Astro.build which happens to be able to do them all.
Seems pretty slick and has lots of integrations already.
- typescript
- astro
- contentful
- firebase
- react
- sass

## Commands
- Change directories into main app: `cd app`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- To run dev mode: `npm run dev`
- For builds: `npm run build`

### Notes
- Run locally with Node after a build: `npx node dist/server/entry.mjs`
